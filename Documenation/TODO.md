# Things to do for nvd_api_interaction v1 Release

- [x] Finish the --get-all function (Thanks @Foo-Maker)
- [x] Write the read me file
- [x] Do a license to get better at remembering to do licenses
- [x] Write some testing for this thing (Thanks @shepherdjay)
- [x] Document the code properly
- [x] Restructure directories to make more sense
- [x] Refactoring for use as a CLI tool. Will release as v1 once that work is done
